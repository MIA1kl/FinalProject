# Proposal: [Tetris Game for Final Exam]

Author: Natalia Klimareva COM19-A

Last updated: 10.05.2020

## Topic addressed by the project

Games and Entertainment

## Background

This is my first java project, so I did not take very complicated ideas for implementation. I also loved the game of Tetris from childhood. Therefore, I was always interested in how it is created.

## Aim of the project (what)

This game allows the player to get rid of boredom and get involved in the game, but the main goal of this project was to acquire new knowledge in compiling code, repeat the topics of inheritance and learn how to use GUI, work with OOP.

## Objectives of the project (why)

During writing the code, I did many research in the internet. I found out how to install and use javafx, how to work with 3 dimentional array, how to import images,how to use so many methods and classes in one project how to create buttons and timer.

## Expected outcomes

Good Emotions

## Proposed activities

Update codes and make a good presentation. 

## Estimative budget)

Free

## Proposed partners

Nobody

# FinalProject

Tetris is a very popular block game that first started in the 80's.
The movement of the blocks is provided by pressing the arrow keys (right and left). The up arrow key rotates the shape, and the down arrow key resets it to the bottom of the window.

On the picture we can see that on the right side there are score and lines. Each completed line adds 10 points to the score and one point to the lines.Every block adds 1 point to the score.

When bloch touch the top of the window, the game is ended.
After finishing the game picture below occurs:

## Compulsory requirements:

a)  GUI - We must create Graphical User Interface Application:

Here we can see libraries for javafx, JFrame- the window, and the vatiables for JFrame.

b) Text I/O - We must work with files as a database (read from files, write to files)

There I have impoted the image for surprizing the person after gaming.

c) Exceptions - You must handle exceptions using Try-Catch blocks
